## Project Closing, 
---
The journey of this project has been extremely insightful into the significance piracy played on the transatlantic slave trade. Starting with the initial hypothesis, that pirates had a significant presence in the slave trade, data was gathered for over 31,000 transatlantic voyages between 1699 and 1827. After the data was gathered it was then organized and processed into two visualization programs, Palladio and Tableau. The final results of the data based on the visualization lead to the conclusion that the original hypothesis for this project was incorrect and that pirates had very little significance on the transatlantic slave trade. However, due to time constraints, this project limited the scope of pirate interaction on transatlantic trade to just those interactions with slave voyages. To anyone interested in expanding on this project, there is still reason to believe that piracy played a significant part on transatlantic trade if data from every pirate encounter, no matter the cargo, was analyzed. 

The scope of this project proved to have many difficulties. First the data provided little in the way of pirate interaction, with just over 100 out of over 31,000 voyages having any sort of pirate interactions. Furthermore, an attempt to understand the economic impact of piracy on the transatlantic slave trade lead to a null result by the fact that there were too many variables effecting the price of slaves, thus making it impossible to gage how much or a financial loss any particular voyage was the origin nation without historical records. 

However, the use of visualization software allowed this project to understand why pirates did not have a significant presence in the slave trade. Moreover, the use of visualization software allowed this project the ability to compare voyages with and without pirate interaction side by side leading to an interesting conclusion that more than double the amount of slaves were lost at sea then captured and sold by pirates.
