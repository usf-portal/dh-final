## Project Credits

* [Stephen Truman](mailto:s.tru989@gmail.com)
    * In this project, I worked on the introduction and data gathering. The introduction focus on explaining the projected course of scholarship and provided some background information related to piracy and slavery. To achieve this, I worked closely with my group members to ensure that the introduction conformed to the study and findings from the historiography and data results provide by my teammates. Furthermore, this introduction explained the digital tools used for this project, providing brief introductions into the utilization of the tools used. Secondly, I was responsible for gathering data to provide our visualization specialist. The data I gathered focus primarily on interaction of piracy on the slave trade from the 1700-1750s to answer a specific question about how piracy effected the economy surrounding the west indies. 
* [Joseph Perez](mailto:joemperez85@gamil.com)
    * By gathering the data generated from the 8-10 sources, we will demonstrate fact-finding visualization comparing the relationship between pirating and slavery in the 1700’s West Indies. The economic relationship regarding the effects of these practices will be examined. There will be a written initial findings and problems encounters report along with diagrams generated using Tableau. Another program that will be used is Orange3 to show a precise relationship and some digital effects for the project. Once the data is scraped and forwarded to vitalization, the imagery is constructed and explained to the viewers. During the scraping and data generating process, the visual producer will review the previous class material along with tutorials to better understand how to input the visualization on Github in a manner that will make sense to the viewers.
* [Mary Elliott](mailto:marye1@mail.usf.edu)
    *  For the group project my role is to extract the data that links trade plundering and piracy in the 1700’s scrapped by the project leader (Stephen) and compose the data in a legible cohesive form similar to a research paper. Arguing that piracy made a significant impact on the economics of the slave trade in the 1700’s. For this I will need to find trends throughout the data by using text analysis and Orange3. I will need to brush up on these topics as these are recently taught in class. Another one of my responsibilities is to compose the historiography surrounding the study of 1700’s piracy in the Caribbean. As a group it is our duty to understand what has already been written and how we as historians can add to the scholarship.  In finalization of the project, I will work with our data visualization expert (Joe) and link the written portion with the respected visualization
