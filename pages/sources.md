## Data Analysis

* The datasets focus on the trade routes especially involved with the Triangular trade. In hopes to understand the movement of slaves into the new world.
* The Database has very specific catagories that focus directly on the slaves rather than other goods transported. This does bode well for the clear preogative the authors are exploring. In this project we are primarily utalizing the catagory in which the authors place importance on the pirate involvement on the economics of the Slave trade.
* The means of organization places a significance on the geolocation of the trade routes. 
* The website provides many visualizations to convay the slave trade as a whole. The visualizations provide extra context in regards to the influx of slaves at certin time periods, and maps that sucessfully visualizes the routes of trade.
