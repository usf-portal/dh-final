# Workflow

Describe your overall workflow here. Think of this as something like when a scientific paper describes their process. The idea is *repeatability*. People need to know how they can get a copy of the data. If you chopped up the data, altered it, or joined it with other data sets they need to know that too.

Discuss (in detail) the processes of

* Getting the data
* Cleaning/altering the data
* Visualizing the data
* Discussing and sharing results with group members

What you need to cover: Talk about every step in your process, talk about how and why you made the decisions that you did. Why did you pick the website that you did? Did you download every record, or just some? Did you download the data directly from the website, or did you use a tool like Webscraper.io? Did you use OpenRefine to change the raw data in some form, and if so, why did you change it the way you did? What program(s) or techniques did you decide on to visualize or analyze it? Why did you feel those programs (e.g. Tableau or Gephi) were better than other options, given your research interest? Did you have to do anything to the data inside Tableau?

Take plenty of screenshots to document your process...
    * **Mac** press 'command' + 'shift' + '4' and then drag a rectangle to take a screenshot of whatever you select... On
    * **Windows**, click the 'Start' button then type 'Snipping' and select Snipping Tool, then click 'New' and drag a rectangle to take a screenshot of whatever you select.

To put your webscraper recipe online...

1. Oopen your sitemap
2. Click the middle menu that says "Sitemap <<your sitemap name>>"
3. Click "Export Sitemap" and copy the JSON data from the form
4. To help readability, go to [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)
5. Paste the raw JSON, click "Process", then copy the output
6. Select and copy the output and put it into a block quote (using the triple backtick ```````).
7. To enable syntax coloring, write the word `json` immediately afterward.
8. To see an example, look at the raw code for the blockquote below.

```json
{  
   "_id":"fake_sitemap",
   "startUrl":[  
      "https://www.fake-url.com"
   ],
   "selectors":[  

   ]
}
```
