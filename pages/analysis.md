# Analysis
---
	
The visualization on this page represents the documented interference
on the slave trade by privateers and pirates between 1699-1827. The primary 
geographical focus is in the Caribbean and West Indies region. These regions 
are where the most slave trade activity took place. The original hypothesis 
for this research is that privates and privateers had a significant effect on 
the slave trade. Pirates and privateers caused fiscal strains on the slave t
rade market and economically effected countries that participated in the slave 
trade. As per the documented information, the slave trade was extremely expansive
that the incursion by privateers had little to no effect on the market itself. 

The images do raise questions to the effects privateers and pirates had on smaller
countries. These smaller states would not have had such availability to the slave 
trade if not provided by the captive ships. The images below demonstrate the 
disparities and theory.

This image represents most of the documented ports where slave 
ships originated. To the left (black dots) the image is of all the ships
that departed and were never held captive and taken over by privateers or 
pirates. The image to the right (purple dots) shows the ports where ships
launched and eventually were taken over by privateers or pirates. The
purpose of these images is to show that at this point there is no significance
between pirated ships and ships that completed their voyage without being 
impeded. The theory is that to this point pirates and privateers were more 
opportunistic scavengers of ships and less methodical in their selection

The path of travel represents paths as the crow flies, although 
traveling ships make the paths. The quantity of activity is a representation 
of over one hundred years but it is easy to see the differences between the 
magnitude of business conducted by ships that were never affected by pirates 
(left image, black lines) and the vessels that will eventually be affected 
by privateers or pirates (right image, purple lines). Here it can be viewed 
how little effect ships captured by these two parties could have had on the 
slave trade. There is still no change in ships and their actions to this point. 
On this image the ships left their home ports and headed to the ports where 
they will be loading slaves onboard.

The slaves are picked up in Africa and journeyed to the Caribbean 
and West Indies region. Until this point, there has been little to no change
in pattern comparing ships never captured to those that were eventually affected 
by privateers or pirates. This image represents the path the vessels took to reach
the slave market ports. The change in behavior occurs in this image. The left image 
shows the mass amount of ships porting into the large slave market hubs. The right 
image shows slaves being dropped off at similar areas but in more sporadic ports 
compared to themasses. The interdiction of ships seems to have occurred closer to
the Caribbean and West Indies region.

A clear visual of the ports where the slaves were dropped off is available in this
image. When comparing both photos of the pirated and non-pirated drop off ports, it 
seems there are no significant changes. Looking a little more closely, one can see
that the pirated ships are spread out more widely in the region and not largely focused 
like the red dots. The larger dots represent the level of drop off. The larger the dots,
the more activity took place in the port.

The most significant change in the region is where the pirated ships dropped off 
their slaves for sale compared to non-pirated vessels. This image shows there was 
a market for pirated slave ships in the West Indies. The standard slave trade ships 
are equally distributed in the slave markets. The larger the dots, the more vessels 
ported and dropped off their slaves. The average slave trade led the ships to Rio in 
Brazil and La Habana, Cuba. In pirated ships, the data shows the ports were more 
concentrated and spread out.

This image is a  more clear representation of the ships and the results that followed
once Pirates and Privateers took control of the vessels. The picture shows the changes 
did not occur until the ship reached the region and ported in a different location than 
non-pirated ships.

These two images compare the price of slaves between 1804-1861 and the
overall sale of pirated ships from 1700-1827. The standard tread is that, 
by year, there was no major significant increase to sold pirated ships when 
comparing the drop and rise on the cost of slave worth. The image shows pirates
were not investing considerable energy to gather wealth by the slave trade. 
Moreover, the representation does indicate the random interaction between pirates
and slave ships. The number of slaves captured and sold by Pirates is deficient 
compared to the significant traffic of slave ships in the area.

The Relative Density comparing all pirated ships and its cargo shows that there
was not a significant influx to ships with slaves and ships without slaves. As 
described above, the region was covered with ships that carried slave in around 
the slave market. The lack of significant to ships with and without slaves shows 
that pirating slaves were not the main focus of pirates and privateers.

![image]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Tableau%20Bars%20.png)

There were nine million-plus slaves, documented, were traded and sold in between
1699-1827 with eight million making it to the slave marker port. Of the over one 
million slaves lost, only a small fraction was due to pirates and privateers. In 
this image, you can see that more slaves lost to sinking ship or unknown reason than
by ships captured by pirates. 

Although the data may not be ironclad,  the massive difference in sum demonstrates 
the pirating of slaves caused no significant effect on the slave market or the 
countries that participated in the practice.
